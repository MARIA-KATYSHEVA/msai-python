## Communication

To respect each other and each other's time, we will use:

- 3 chats to learn python: for students only, for students and teachers and memes chat
- [Anonymous form](https://forms.gle/dkXA2ETwcRNhUL4X9)
- Questions time before classes
- Calendar


### Chat for students only

Teachers are not allowed in students only chat. Probably you already have one, if not, create it, and share it with others.

You are free to spread gossip, to laugh at teachers, and to ask each other the silliest Python questions (but remember - somebody can forward your messages).

Most importantly, you can help each other, share links to any materials thatÂ helpedÂ you, etc.


### Chat for students and teachers [to be created]

This is our official community.

There, you can ask for help from teachers if students' power is not enough. You can also offer something or share materials that augment our course â€” I will comment on it and probably include it into course content.

You are free to provide any objective critique â€” that is a compliment to me, because you demonstrate involvement and make us better instead of silent outrage.

If it is not a question of grave and imminent danger, don't text me or someone else directly â€” use common chat instead. That way, you are helping those who have the same questions.

I will try to answer same day, but reserve the right to answer within 7 days. Probably in most cases help comes from someone who quicker than me, that's totally ok ðŸ™‚


### Memes chat [to be created]

### [Anonymous form](https://forms.gle/dkXA2ETwcRNhUL4X9)

Please share any feedback and complaints there. Only I have access to form submissions, but I can share it with somebody if I deem it necessary.


### Questions time before classes

I will join our classes 10-15 minutes before the start. If you what, you can also join it and ask anything.


### Calendar

Our course has a calendar, that you can subscribe to. Ask course admins to join the calendar.

Events will have notifications and contain zoom links to classes. Links will also be sent into course chat before classes begin.



## Homework

Readable, understandable and enjoyable code comes from programmers who read, understand and get inspired by tons of someone else's code. Who inherits cool techniques and approaches. Besides, there are too many students for me to give high-quality reviews for everyone's homework every week.

That's why we are using **1-to-5 technique:**

- Every homework goes to 5 random students for review
- Every student gets 5 random works to make a review
- Providing reviews is part of homework
  - *You don't need to give a mark, only comment code, notice errors, give some advice on code style and how to make it simpler and clearer.*
- You need to send your homework before the **sending deadline** and provide reviews before the **review deadline**, which is one week later
  - *If you miss a deadline, it affects your groupmates. Fortunately, every work has 5 reviewers and every student has 5 submitters. â€” if 1 or 2 works will be missed, it is not a tragedy.*

To make it more fun, every home assignment may have several variants. You will have a random one. Of course, you can solve as many variants as you want, but without review assurance.

In addition to students' reviews, I will make reviews of some of your code and will check how you do a review.

Also, I will invite some of you to a call to check if you understand the course topics and the code you are writing. This is a standard "healthcheck" technique. There is no need to worry, unless you are cheating. I highly recommend doing your homework on your own and only using Google for documentation. However, you are free to peek at solutions on the internet or from your groupmates. But if you just copy and paste code without an understanding of how it works, it may affect your grade.



## Marks, missed deadlines and non-attendance

Your mark for Python course depends on your activity during the process and final exam.

As it comes from "1-to-5 technique", missed deadlines lead to situations where your code review is not performed and somebody's review is not performed. Sending homework and making a review after deadline is not prohibited, but completely optional for everybody.

To motivate you to respect deadlines, **30% of mark is deadline compliance.**

Weird as it sounds, the quality of your homework doesn't affect your mark. It only affects your understanding of python, your coding skills, your exam preparation, and future achievements. So it's only on your conscience ðŸ˜‰. But to respect the time of those who send and review homework, fictitious work will be rated by a negative number of points.

Workshops are also an important part of our course. During workshops you will receive knowledge which is missed in lectures, you will practice programming, and enjoy live interaction with teachers and other students which is so lacking in online courses. Of course, situations when you can't visit classes may happen. But remember that in that case you are missing part of knowledge and experience.

Also, missed classes and home assignments may give your examiner a hint of what to ask about ðŸ˜‰.

The exam will be held at the end of the course. **70% of mark is your exam result.**



## Superstars

If you don't see the point of learning this course, because you already have excellent Python knowledge (or think you have), [text me](https://t.me/nlevashov) about this. I will examine you and give you individual tasks to boost your knowledge and be helpful to other students.
