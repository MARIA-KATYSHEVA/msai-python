## Communication

To respect each other and each other's time, we will use:

- $3$ chats to learn python: for students only, for students and teachers and memes chat
- [Anonymous form] the link will be here
- Questions time before classes


### Chat for students only

Teachers are not allowed in students only chat. Probably you already have one, if not, create it, and share it with others.

You are free to spread gossip, to laugh at teachers, and to ask each other the silliest Python questions (but remember - somebody can forward your messages).

Most importantly, you can help each other, share links to any materials that helped you, etc.


### Chat for students and teachers

This is our official community.

There, you can ask for help from teachers if students' power is not enough. You can also offer something or share materials that augment our course â€” I will comment on it and probably include it into course content.

You are free to provide any objective critique â€” that is a compliment to me, because you demonstrate involvement and make us better instead of silent outrage.

If it is not a question of grave and imminent danger, don't text me or someone else directly â€” use common chat instead. That way, you are helping those who have the same questions.

I will try to answer same day, but reserve the right to answer within $7$ days. Probably in most cases help comes from someone who quicker than me, that's totally ok ðŸ™‚


### Memes chat (look for invite link in course chat)

### Anonymous form (add the link)

Please share any feedback and complaints there. Only I have access to form submissions, but I can share it with somebody if I deem it necessary.


### Questions time before classes

I will join our classes $10-15$ minutes before the start. If you want, you can also join it and ask anything.



## Homework

During the course you will receive $8$ homework assignments: $4$ in intro block and $4$ in main block.



## Marks, non-attendance and missed deadlines

Your mark for Python course depends on your activity during the process and exam project.


### Marks and non-attendance

Your estimated activities, summed up in the ```total``` variable:
- warm-up tests x $10$ - $1$ point
- midterm test $(22.10.22)$ - $20$ points
- finalterm test (date will be here later) - $20$ points
- exam project - $30$ points
- home assignments x $8$ - $5$ points

So you can score max: $10 + 20 + 20 + 30 + 40 = 120$ points and after that compute your mark by the formula:

```your_semester_mark = int(min((100, total)) / 10)"```

Webinars are also an important part of our course. During webinars you will receive knowledge which is missed in lectures, you will practice programming, and enjoy live interaction with teachers and other students which is so lacking in online courses. Of course, situations when you can't visit webinars may happen. But remember that in that case you are missing part of knowledge, experience and $1$ warm-up test point.

Also, missed webinars and home assignments may give your examiner a hint of what to ask about ðŸ˜‰.

The exam will be held at the end of the course.

Information about exam projects will appear later.


### Deadlines

Everything is very simple here: after **soft** deadline your points for activity multiplied by $0.5$ and $0.0$ after **hard** deadline



## Superstars

If you don't see the point of learning this course, because you already have Python knowledge, [text me](https://t.me/isklonin) or [Nick](https://t.me/nlevashov) about this. We will examine you and give you individual tasks to boost your knowledge and be helpful to other students.
