## Code review tips

We use student's emails as identifiers.

After the sending deadline link to Home Assignment table is published. Table has 2 sheets:
- **Reviewers table** — distribution who needs to review whom. There you can find emails of students, whose solutions assigned to you for review.
- **Form submissions** — emails with submitted home assignment's solutions. There you can find solutions by email.

### General code review recommendations

- The reviewer has 2 tasks: to check logic (if the task is formally solved) and to check style (if the code can be written better)
- You don't need to give a mark, you only need to comment code, notice errors, give some advice on code style and how to make it simpler and clearer
- Don't hesitate to look for other decisions and comments to make better review
- Review is not necessarily critique — if you see interesting/extraordinary ways to solve the task, leave a compliment
- You can run code to make sure it is working
- You can also review other students solutions, especially if you see that something important is missed by assigned reviewers — it is welcomed

### When code is in Google Spreadsheet cells

- If the solution is so simple that you don't have anything to comment (or to add to previous reviews) then just leave "+" comment
- If some cells are hard to review in the Google Docs interface, you can copy the code to somewhere else and then come back with a comment


### What to do with reviews for your work?

Of course, you need to read them and learn what you missed. You can also ask for details in comments / in chats. You can fix your errors locally to memorize the correct decisions.


### What to do if you've missed the sending deadline but still want to finish HA or make a review?

**If you want to submit:** it is welcomed. HA forms are open till the end of our course, so you can make a submission after deadline. It is not guaranteed, but somebody may perform a review for you submission. Especially if you ask in chats.

**If you want to review:** it is welcomed. Feel free to comment on any sent solution. Since students that passed deadlines have reviewers, you may prefer those who submit HA after the deadline.

Even if you submit HA after the deadline or/and review somebody, of course, you won't get score points. Otherwise, it wouldn't be fair to other students. But still, you have the opportunity to earn the experience.
